This folder has "settings.json" which stores settings that enable the GUI to continue where it left off.
For example, it saves,
    path to the currently opened book (the GUI opens the same book when it starts so that the user can continue)
    the recently opened books (the user can open a dialog to choose from a list of recently opened books),
    the state of the GUI when closing (i.e. zoomed or normal) to start with the same state next time it is opened,
    etc.
